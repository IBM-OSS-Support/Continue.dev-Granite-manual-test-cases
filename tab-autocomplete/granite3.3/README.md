## 🔬 Insights & Model Comparisons

### 🧩 Template Format Impact

- **FIM** (Fill-in-the-Middle) clearly outperformed **HFT** (Hole-Filler) across the board.
- FIM handled **prefix + suffix** completions much better than HFT, which often failed in logic-heavy completions.
- HFT exhibited:
  - Misplaced control flow (`else` without matching `if`)
  - Missing return statements
  - Incomplete logic for bonus, pandas chaining, and tax brackets.

### 💡 Correctness vs Acceptability

- Both FIM models delivered **>75% accurate completions**.
- HFT dropped to **~40% correctness**, with notable bugs.
- Some completions were verbose but logically valid, while others needed trimming or manual indentation.
- `8b-instruct (FIM)` was also suggesting good test cases at the end to run on the functions that was filled.

### 👎 Esc Usage as Friction Signal

- Esc count serves as a useful friction signal:
  - `2b-base (FIM)`: **3 Esc presses**
  - `8b-instruct (FIM)`: **9 Esc presses**
  - `8b-instruct (HFT)`: **13 Esc presses**
- High Esc usage with HFT indicates **developer dissatisfaction** and frequent interruption to correct output.

### 💬 UX Issues Observed

- `8b-instruct (FIM)` showed **repeating completions** in some cases (e.g., Employee class).
- All models overgenerated at times, especially on pandas aggregations.
- Indentation bugs were present in multiple completions — mostly recoverable, but a sign of prompt misalignment.

## 🏆 Final Ranking

| Rank | Model                    | Reasoning |
|------|--------------------------|-----------|
| 🥇 1 | `granite3.3:2b-base (FIM)`     | Compact, consistent, and low-friction completions |
| 🥈 2 | `granite3.3:8b-instruct (FIM)` | More powerful logic but occasional noise and repetition |
| 🥉 3 | `granite3.3:8b-instruct (HFT)` | Frequent logic errors, high rejection rate |

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- ✅ Prefer **FIM template** for all code completion tasks.
- ✅ Use **2b-base (FIM)** for efficiency-critical environments.
- 🧪 Apply **8b-instruct (FIM)** where richer logic is required, but monitor for repetition bugs.
- ⚠️ Avoid using **8b-instruct (HFT)** as default; not robust enough without better prompt tuning.

## 📝 Note

These models were evaluated using a limited and curated set of 12 Python code completion scenarios.  
The test cases were selected to span various real-world programming patterns (e.g., recursion, conditionals, pandas usage), but they do **not comprehensively cover** the entire scope of Python programming.

All observations were based on interactive completions during **a few manual test runs**.  
Performance may vary under different coding environments, datasets, or usage patterns.  
This report is intended to give a directional insight rather than an exhaustive benchmark.
