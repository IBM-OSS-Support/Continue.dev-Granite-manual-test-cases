# LLM Code Completion Prompts

The `tests.py` file contains prompt examples for evaluating code completion models using:

- **Prefix-only completion**
- **(prefix and suffix, model fills the gap)**

---

## How to Use These Prompts

**Do NOT copy the entire Python file into your editor at once.**  
Instead, for best results:

1. **Pick a single use case block** (for example, "Recursive Logic" or "Exception Handling with Custom Messages").
2. Copy **just that block** (including the cursor marker comment, e.g. `# <<< cursor here >>>`).
3. Paste it into your code editor in Continue.dev (or your LLM-based tool).
4. **Place your cursor exactly at the cursor marker** and delete the marker comment.
5. Trigger tab completion/autocomplete.
6. The model will generate the appropriate code for that specific use case.
