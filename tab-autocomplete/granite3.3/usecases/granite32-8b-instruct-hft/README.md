# Granite3.2:8b-instruct (HFT) ‚Äî Code Completion Evaluation Report

## Overview

This report evaluates the code completion performance of the `granite3.2:8b-instruct` model using the **Hole-Filler Template (HFT)** across 12 unified Python code test cases. Each test case was assessed for:

- Accuracy of the model's code completion
- Alignment with expected logic
- Tab (accept) and Esc (reject) behavior
- Structural and syntactic quality of completions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These models were evaluated on a curated but limited set of examples and use cases. The results reflect performance on those specific tasks and should not be treated as a comprehensive measure of the model's full Python capabilities.

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **Correct Completions:** 3 / 12
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Acceptable:** 1
- ‚ùå **Incorrect:** 8
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Tab Accepts:** 20
- üõë **Esc Rejects:** 25

## Observations

- üîª **Major weaknesses in handling suffix-based FIM tasks**, especially tax bracket logic and pandas operations.
- üîª Many completions were syntactically **broken** or **illogically structured**, particularly with control flow and dictionary formatting.
- üîª Even when the semantic meaning was close, indentation and formatting often made the code unusable.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simple constructs like **recursive functions** and **lambdas** performed reasonably well.
- üê¢ **Response latency** was notably **higher** than in other evaluated models.
