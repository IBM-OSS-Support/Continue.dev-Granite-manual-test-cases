It returns the index of the target if it's present in the array; otherwise, it returns `-1`. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm continues on the lower half. Otherwise, it continues on the upper half. This process repeats until the target value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nThe function begins by initializing two pointers: `left` at the start of the array (index 0) and `right` at the end of the array (index `len(arr) - 1`). It then enters a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n\nInside this loop, it calculates the middle index (`mid`) using integer division. If the value at the middle index equals the target, the function returns this index. If the value at the middle index is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the array (i.e., `left` becomes `mid + 1`). Conversely, if the value at the middle index is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half of the array (i.e., `right` becomes `mid - 1`).\n\nIf the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target was not found in the array.\n"

Args:  arr (list): The sorted array to search.  target: The element to search for.  Returns:  int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.  \n\n\n ''' low = 0  high = len(arr) - 1  while low <= high:  mid = (low + high) \n\n 2  if arr[mid] == target:  return mid  elif arr[mid] < target:  low = mid + 1  else:  high = mid - 1 \n\n return -1 \n\n # Example usage: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15] target = 9 \n\n result = binary_search(arr, target) \n\n if result != -1:  print(f\"Element {target} found at index {result}\") \n else:  print(f\"Element {target} not found in array\") ''' \n ### Documentation\n\n #### Functions  *  `binary_search(arr, target)`: Searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.  \n *  Args:  * \n `arr (list)`: The sorted array to search.  \n*  `target`: The element to search for. \n *  Returns:  * \n `int`: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise. \n #### Variables  *  `low` (int): The lower bound of the search range. Initially set to 0. *  `high` (int): The upper bound of the search range. Initially set to the length of the array minus 1. *  `mid` (int): The middle index of the current search range. #### Algorithm  1.  Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the array minus 1. 2.  While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:  *  Calculate the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.  *  If `arr[mid] == target`, return the index `mid`.  *  If `arr[mid] < target`, update `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half of the array.  *  Otherwise, update `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half of the array. 3.  If the loop ends without finding the target element, return -1 to indicate that the element is not found. ### Time Complexity  The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the array. This makes it much more efficient than linear search for large datasets."
