## Second Execution:

Bank Account Management System

This program allows you to create new bank accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check balance, and display transaction history.

Here's a breakdown of the classes and their functions:

1. BankAccount class: This class represents a single bank account and has the following methods:
   - __init__(account_number, balance=0): Initializes the account with an account number and initial balance (default is 0).
   - deposit(amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
   - withdraw(amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance if it's available. If not, it displays a message indicating insufficient funds.
   - check_balance(): Returns the current balance of the account.
   - display_transactions(): Prints out all the transactions that have been made in this account.

2. BankSystem class: This class represents the entire bank system and has the following methods:
   - __init__(): Initializes an empty dictionary to store accounts.
   - create_account(account_number): Creates a new account with the specified account number. If the account already exists, it displays a message indicating so.
   - get_account(account_number): Returns the account object corresponding to the given account number.

Here's an example of how you can use the program:

```python
# Create a bank system
bank = BankSystem()

# Create new accounts
bank.create_account("12345")
bank.create_account("67890")

# Deposit funds
account1 = bank.get_account("12345")
account1.deposit(100)

# Withdraw funds
account2 = bank.get_account("67890")
account2.withdraw(50)

# Check balance and display transaction history
print(account1.check_balance())  # Output: 100
account1.display_transactions()   # Output: Deposited 100
print(account2.check_balance())  # Output: 50
account2.display_transactions()   # Output: Withdrew 50
```


## Third Execution:

The code provided is a Python program that allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw funds from those accounts, check the balance of a specific account, and display transaction history. 
The program uses a BankSystem class to manage multiple accounts, with each account having an account number, balance, and transaction history. 
The BankAccount class represents an individual bank account, which has methods for depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and displaying transactions.

To use the code, users can run the main function, which presents a menu of options to the user. 
They can choose from creating a new account, depositing funds into an existing account, withdrawing funds from an account, checking the balance of an account, displaying transaction history for an account, or exiting the program.

The BankSystem class maintains a dictionary of accounts, with each account number as the key and the corresponding BankAccount object as the value. 
The create_account method allows users to create new accounts by providing an account number. If the account number already exists, it prints an error message.
The get_account method retrieves the BankAccount object for a given account number from the dictionary.

The BankAccount class represents an individual bank account. It has an __init__ method that initializes the account number, balance, and transaction history attributes. 
The deposit method adds the specified amount to the account balance and appends a "Deposited X" message to the transaction history. 
The withdraw method checks if the requested withdrawal amount is greater than the available balance, and if not, subtracts the amount from the balance and appends a "Withdrew X" message to the transaction history. 
If the withdrawal amount is insufficient, it prints an error message and returns False. The check_balance method returns the current balance of the account. 
The display_transactions method iterates through the transaction history and prints each entry.

Overall, this code provides a simple banking system with basic functionality for managing accounts and transactions. 
However, there are a few features that could be added to improve its usability or security. 
For example, users could be prompted for confirmation before making large withdrawals, error handling for invalid account numbers or input, and support for multiple currencies could be added.


## Fourth Execution: 
The given Python script `documentation.py` is a simple bank account management system. It allows users to create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check balance, and display transaction history. 
The code uses two classes: `BankAccount` and `BankSystem`. The `BankAccount` class represents an individual bank account and has methods for depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and displaying transactions. 
The `BankSystem` class manages a collection of accounts and provides methods for creating new accounts and retrieving existing ones.

The code also includes a main function that presents a menu-based interface to the user. The user can choose from options such as creating a new account, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking balance, displaying transaction history, or exiting the program. 
The script prompts the user for input and performs the corresponding actions on the bank system.

To write documentation for this code, we need to understand the purpose of each class and its methods, as well as the main function that controls the flow of execution. 
We can document the classes and their methods using docstrings and provide a brief description of the main function's purpose. 
Additionally, we may want to include information about any external dependencies or resources used by the code.

Here is an example of how you might document the `BankAccount` class:

```python
class BankAccount:
    """Represents a bank account and provides methods for depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and displaying transactions."""

    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance
        self.transactions = []

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposit the specified amount into the account."""
        self.balance += amount
        self.transactions.append(f"Deposited {amount}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Withdraw the specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available."""
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds!")
            return False
        self.balance -= amount
        self.transactions.append(f"Withdrew {amount}")
        return True

    def check_balance(self):
        """Return the current balance of the account."""
        return self.balance

    def display_transactions(self):
        """Display all transactions made on the account."""
        for transaction in self.transactions:
            print(transaction)
```

In this example, we have provided a docstring at the top of the `BankAccount` class that briefly describes its purpose and provides some context for the methods. 
The docstrings for the other classes and functions can be similarly written to provide comprehensive documentation for the entire code base.


## Fifth Execution 

# Bank Account Management System
This Python program provides a simple bank account management system with the ability to create new accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balance, and display transaction history.
## Classes
There are two classes in this program - `BankAccount` and `BankSystem`. The `BankAccount` class represents a single bank account and has attributes such as account number, balance, and transaction history. It also includes methods for depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking balance, and displaying transactions.
The `BankSystem` class acts as the main system for managing multiple bank accounts. It has an attribute called `accounts`, which is a dictionary mapping account numbers to instances of the `BankAccount` class. The `create_account` method allows users to create new accounts by providing an account number. The `get_account` method retrieves the `BankAccount` instance associated with a given account number.
## Main Function
The `main` function provides a simple user interface for interacting with the bank system. It displays a menu of options and prompts the user to choose one. Based on the user's choice, it performs the corresponding action, such as creating a new account, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, checking balance, or displaying transaction history.
## Sample Output
Here is an example of how the program might output when creating a new account and depositing funds:
```
Bank Account Management System
1. Create new account
2. Deposit funds
3. Withdraw funds
4. Check balance
5. Display transaction history
6. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter new account number: 12345
Account created successfully!
Enter your choice: 2
Enter account number: 12345
Enter deposit amount: 1000
Deposit successful!
```
