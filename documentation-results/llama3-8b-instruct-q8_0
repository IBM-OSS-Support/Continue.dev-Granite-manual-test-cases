**Documentation for Bank Account Management System**

**Overview**
-----------

This is a Python implementation of a simple bank account management system. The system allows users to create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check their balance, and display transaction history.

**Classes**
----------

### `BankAccount`

*   **Attributes:**
    *   `account_number`: Unique identifier for the account.
    *   `balance`: Current balance of the account (default is 0).
    *   `transactions`: List of transactions performed on the account.
*   **Methods:**
    *   `__init__(self, account_number, balance=0)`: Initializes a new bank account with an account number and optional initial balance.
    *   `deposit(self, amount)`: Deposits the specified amount into the account and records it in the transaction history.
    *   `withdraw(self, amount)`: Withdraws the specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available; otherwise, returns False. Records the withdrawal in the transaction history if successful.
    *   `check_balance(self)`: Returns the current balance of the account.
    *   `display_transactions(self)`: Prints a list of all transactions performed on the account.

### `BankSystem`

*   **Attributes:**
    *   `accounts`: Dictionary mapping account numbers to corresponding bank account objects.
*   **Methods:**
    *   `__init__(self)`: Initializes an empty bank system with no accounts.
    *   `create_account(self, account_number)`: Creates a new bank account with the specified account number if it does not already exist in the system. Returns True on success; otherwise, returns False.
    *   `get_account(self, account_number)`: Retrieves the bank account object associated with the specified account number or returns None if no such account exists.

**Main Function**
----------------

*   **Description:** The main function implements a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the bank system.
*   **Usage:**

    1.  Create new accounts using `BankSystem.create_account()`.
    2.  Deposit funds into an existing account using `BankAccount.deposit()`.
    3.  Withdraw funds from an existing account using `BankAccount.withdraw()`.
    4.  Check the balance of an existing account using `BankAccount.check_balance()`.
    5.  Display transaction history for an existing account using `BankAccount.display_transactions()`.

**Example Usage**
-----------------

```python
# Create a new bank system
bank_system = BankSystem()

# Create a new account with account number "12345"
bank_system.create_account("12345")

# Get the account object associated with account number "12345"
account = bank_system.get_account("12345")

# Deposit $100 into the account
account.deposit(100)

# Withdraw $50 from the account
account.withdraw(50)

# Check the balance of the account
print(account.check_balance())

# Display transaction history for the account
account.display_transactions()
```
