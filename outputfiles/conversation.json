          "assistant": "Based on current best practices in Python programming, the top 2 coding practices are:\n1. Follow PEP 8 Style Guide\nThis is consistently ranked as the #1 practice and includes:\n- Using 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)\n- Limiting line length to 79 characters\n- Using proper naming conventions:\n- snake_case for functions and variables\n- CapWords for classes\n- UPPERCASE for constants\nHere's a simple example:\n```python example.py\n# Good PEP 8 style\nclass UserAccount:\nMAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3\ndef validate_user_credentials(self, username, password):\nlogin_successful = False\n# Rest of the code\n```\n2. Write Clear Documentation and Comments\n- Always include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions\n- Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic\n- Use type hints for better code readability\nExample:\n```python documentation.py\nfrom typing import List, Dict\ndef process_user_data(users: List[Dict]) -> Dict:\n\"\"\"\nProcess user information and return summarized data.\nArgs:\nusers: List of dictionaries containing user information\nReturns:\nDictionary with processed user statistics\n\"\"\"\n# Process user data here\nreturn processed_data\n```\nThese practices help maintain code readability, consistency, and maintainability across Python projects."

Tarballs and ZIP Archive support a wider assortment of\ncompression methods.\nsource code is audited to ensure that all size computations are carried\nout using 64-bit signed integers as well.  SQLite will\nrefuse to allocate more than about 2GB of memory at one go.  (In common\nuse, SQLite seldom ever allocates more than about 8KB of memory at a time\nso a 2GB allocation limit is not a burden.)  So the 64-bit size parameter\nprovides lots of headroom for detecting overflows.  The same audit that\nverifies that all size computations are done as 64-bit signed integers\nPRAGMA soft_heap_limit=NThis pragma invokes the sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() interface with\nthe argument N, if N is specified and is a non-negative integer.\nThe soft_heap_limit pragma always returns the same integer\nthat would be returned by the sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64(-1) C-language\nfunction.\nSee also the hard_heap_limit pragma.\nPRAGMA stats; This pragma returns auxiliary information about tables and\nThis pragma is deprecated and exists\nfor backwards compatibility only.  New applications\nshould avoid using this pragma.  Older applications should discontinue\nuse of this pragma at the earliest opportunity.  This pragma may be omitted\nfrom the build when SQLite is compiled using SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED.\nPRAGMA cell_size_check\nPRAGMA cell_size_check = boolean;The cell_size_check pragma enables or disables additional sanity\nAs of version 3.7.6 (2011-04-12),\nSQLite includes a new virtual table module called\n\"fts4aux\", which can be used to inspect the full-text index of an existing\nFTS table directly. Despite its name, fts4aux works just as well with FTS3\ntables as it does with FTS4 tables. Fts4aux tables are read-only. The only\nway to modify the contents of an fts4aux table is by modifying the\ncontents of the associated FTS table. The fts4aux module is automatically\nThe tables necessary to do full and proper unicode case folding are\nlarger than the whole SQLite library.\nFull unicode case folding is supported in SQLite if it is compiled\nwith the -DSQLITE_ENABLE_ICU option and linked against the\nInternational Components for Unicode\nlibrary.\nThe bytecode and tables_used tables are only available if SQLite has\nbeen compiled with the -DSQLITE_ENABLE_BYTECODE_VTAB compile-time option.\nThe CLI has been compiled that way, and so you can use the standard\nCLI as a test platform to experiement.\nBoth virtual tables are read-only eponymous-only virtual tables.  You use them\nby mentioning them directly in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement.\nThey both require a single argument which is the SQL statement to be\nanalyzed.

The total heap space used for\nlookaside continues to be sz*cnt bytes.  But the space is allocated\nbetween the small-slot lookaside and big-slot lookaside, with\npreference given to small-slot lookaside.  The total number of\nslots will usually exceed \"cnt\", since \"sz\" is typically much\nlarger than the small-slot size of 128 bytes.\nThe default lookaside configuration has changed from 100 slots\nThe default page cache that is built into SQLite honors the request,\nhowever alternative application-defined page cache implementations\nmay choose to interpret the suggested cache size in different ways\nor to ignore it all together.\nThe default suggested cache size is -2000, which means the cache size\nis limited to 2048000 bytes of memory.\nThe default suggested cache size can be altered using the\nSQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE compile-time options.\nIf you are an SQLite user whose has stumbled over some quirk of\nSQLite that is not mentioned here, please let the developers know\nby posting a brief message on the\nSQLite Forum.\nBecause SQLite is flexible and forgiving with regard to datatypes,\ntable columns can be created that have no specified datatype at all.\nFor example:\nCREATE TABLE t1(a,b,c,d);\nThe table \"t1\" has four columns \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\" that have\nno particular datatype assigned.

However, applications with unusual or particularly\nstrict requirements may want to adjust the configuration to more closely\nalign SQLite to their needs.\nBoth compile-time and start-time configuration options are available.\nBy default, SQLite keeps statistics on its memory usage.  These\nstatistics are useful in helping to determine how much memory an\napplication really needs.  The statistics can also be used in\nhigh-reliability system to determine\nif the memory usage is coming close to or exceeding the limits\nof the Robson proof and hence that the memory allocation subsystem is\nliable to breakdown.Most memory statistics are global, and therefore the tracking of\nAs of SQLite version 3.37.0 (2021-11-27), SQLite supports this\ndevelopment style using STRICT tables.\nIf you find a real-world case where STRICT tables prevented or\nwould have prevented a bug in an application, please post a message to the\nSQLite Forum so that we can add your story\nto this document.\ngcc 9.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.04.5 x64: 650 KB\nYour mileage may vary.\nLibrary size will likely be larger\nwhen including optional features such as full-text search or r-tree indexes,\nor when using more aggressive compiler options such as -O3.\nThis document is intended only as a general guideline to the\ncompiled size of the SQLite library.
