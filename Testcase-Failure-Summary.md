### Summary of Failures 
1. Bug Fixing
* Input: Code with a known bug, requiring a fix and clear explanation.
* Actual Output: The bug explanation provided was vague and contradictory. The fix itself didn't fully address the problem.
* Expected Output: Clear and concise explanation of the bug with a correct and fully implemented fix.
* Reason for Failure: The explanation lacked clarity, and the fix didn’t comprehensively solve the issue.

2. Code Transformation
* Input: A code segment that required transforming an existing implementation into a cleaner, more efficient solution using a different loop construct.
* Actual Output: The transformed code had repeated variables, errors in logic, and an incorrectly implemented do-while loop. It also exhibited inconsistent structure and unclear flow.
* Expected Output: Properly restructured code with no repeated variables, a correctly implemented do-while loop, and a consistent code style.
* Reason for Failure: The refactoring approach failed to consider optimal coding practices and introduced multiple errors, affecting the overall code flow.

3. Refactoring
* Input: Refactor a portion of the code to integrate Quarkus features, improving performance and scalability.
* Actual Output: The code was refactored, but it didn’t fully incorporate the necessary Quarkus features, such as annotations, configuration, or dependency injection.
* Expected Output: A fully refactored solution that properly utilizes Quarkus' capabilities, improving the code's efficiency.
* Reason for Failure: The refactored code did not leverage Quarkus features effectively, missing opportunities for optimization.

4. Documentation
* Input: A codebase with documentation for a core banking system. The documentation needed to describe the system's functionality, including edge case handling, error handling, user feedback, and type annotations.
* Actual Output: The documentation covered core banking functionality but lacked sufficient detail on data validation, error handling, user feedback, and type annotations.
* Expected Output: Comprehensive documentation covering all aspects, including clear explanations of data validation, error handling, user feedback mechanisms, and type annotations.
* Reason for Failure: The documentation did not provide adequate coverage on key areas like validation, error handling, and annotations.

5. Unit Testcase
* Input: A set of unit tests meant to cover various aspects of the application, including edge cases, error handling, and user feedback.
* Actual Output: The tests did not cover edge cases, error handling, user feedback, or input validation.
* Expected Output: Comprehensive unit tests that address edge cases, error handling, and provide proper validation and feedback.
* Reason for Failure: The test cases lacked coverage for critical scenarios, resulting in missed edge cases and untested conditions.
